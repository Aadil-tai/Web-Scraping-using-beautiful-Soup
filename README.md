## <font color='green'>Introduction</font>

- Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from websites.
- It involves fetching the content of web pages and parsing the HTML to retrieve the data needed.
- BeautifulSoup is a powerful Python library that simplifies the process of web scraping by providing methods to navigate and search the HTML tree.
- In this notebook, I demonstrated how I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a Wikipedia page.
    - The steps included making an HTTP request to fetch the page content, parsing the HTML, and extracting specific elements such as links, tables, and other tags.
    - Each step is accompanied by explanations and code snippets to illustrate the process.
